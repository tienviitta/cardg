	LSP
	---

	                    Thanks for trying out the LSP package!
	                    ======================================


	  This package is a "client" implementation of the "language server protocol".
	  This is a protocol that defines how (language) servers and clients (editors)
	  should talk to each other. It enables high-quality code-complete,
	  signature-help, goto-def, accurate find-references, and more.

	  This package doesn't actually contain any language server by itself. It
	  provides only the glue code to attach language servers to Sublime Text.

	  Exactly which concepts from LSP should map to which concepts from Sublime
	  Text and vice versa is an ongoing research problem. We're certainly still
	  figuring things out!

	  To get up and running for your favorite language, open the documentation at

	      https://lsp.sublimetext.io

	LSP-clangd
	----------

	  ## Installation
	  - Install LSP and LSP-clangd from Package Control
	  - Install clangd using your package manager or let this plugin install clangd for you

	  ## Usage

	  By default, clangd will assume your code is built as clang some_file.cc, and youâ€™ll probably get errors about missing #included files, etc. 

	  For complex projects clangd needs to know your build flags. This can be done using a `compile_commands.json` or `compile_flags.txt` file.

	  See https://clangd.llvm.org/installation#project-setup

	  - Syntax highlighting for .cmake and CMakeLists.txt files
	  - CMakeCache.txt syntax highlighting
	  - CMake "config" header syntax (*.h.in and *.hpp.in files)
	  - Various static completions for built-in cmake functions

	GitSavvy
	--------

	  # Welcome to GitSavvy

	  GitSavvy provides integration between Sublime Text 3 and Git.

	  If you're a new user and you find yourself asking, _"Can GitSavvy do X?"_, there are two places to look.  First, open your command palette and type `GitSavvy: help`.  This will take you to the offline wiki-style documentation.

	  You can also check for configurability options by opening `Preferences > Package Settings > GitSavvy > Settings - Default` in the ST3 menu.  Any optional or configurable behavior will be documented here, along with the default values.

	  Finally, if at any time you encounter a bug, or if you wish that GitSavvy included some missing functionality, please open an issue:
	  https://github.com/timbrel/GitSavvy/issues
