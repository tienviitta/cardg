"Playing cards are used quite a bit out in the world, so why not implement them so we can play games on computers too?  We will implement just normal playing cards here, nothing as crazy as Magic or something!  This video creates a Card class, then a Deck class that manages the 52 cards that get created.  We use OOP, dynamic memory, enumerations, vectors/deques, STL algorithms, and so much more!
